# Development Guidelines

## Code Modification Guidelines
- Modify code one line at a time so changes are easy to read in the diff
- Each change should be explained before making it
- Wait for confirmation before proceeding to next change

## Code Organization Guidelines
- Always search for existing code before creating new code or files
- Follow the Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) principle:
  - Avoid duplicating code or functionality
  - Extract common patterns into reusable functions or classes
  - Use inheritance and composition to share behavior
  - Maintain single source of truth for business logic
