# Session 2024-12-25 12:36

## Focus
Review and improve project documentation organization and standards, with emphasis on session management and incremental development practices.

## Running Log
- 12:36 - Session started, began reviewing project documentation
- 12:38 - Analyzed catalog-related files to understand system functionality
- 12:42 - Evaluated necessity of docs/ subdirectories
- 12:44 - Decided to maintain flat documentation structure following "Necessary and Sufficient" principle
- 12:47 - Added "Incremental Development" principle to PROJECT_PLAN.md
- 12:49 - Updated documentation structure in PROJECT_PLAN.md while preserving content
- 12:51 - Identified missing documentation for session log start requirement
- 12:53 - Updated AI_SESSION_GUIDE.md and CHAT_START.md to include session log requirements
- 12:54 - Created documentation index in README.md
- 12:55 - Added missing CHAT_CLOSE.md reference to README.md documentation index
- 12:56 - Identified documentation files requiring name standardization:
  - `guidelines.md` -> `GUIDELINES.md`
  - `SETUP.md` -> `SETUP_GUIDE.md`
  - `CATALOG_BACKLOG.md` -> `BACKLOG.md`
- 12:57 - Found that `GUIDELINES.md` already exists with same content as `guidelines.md`
  - Decision: Archive lowercase version as it's redundant
- 13:00 - Evaluated backlog management approaches
- 13:04 - Analyzed pros and cons of workstream-based file structure
- 13:06 - Decided on simplified single-file backlog approach
  - Reduces navigation complexity
  - Maintains single source of truth
  - Better aligns with "Necessary and Sufficient" principle
  - Provides clearer project overview
- 13:08 - Decided to keep existing BACKLOG.md as base document
  - Will merge CATALOG_BACKLOG.md content into it
  - Will restructure to reflect workstream organization
  - Preserves existing backlog history and content
- 13:09 - Added catalog core components to unified backlog
- 13:10 - Completed catalog backlog merge:
  - Added implementation phases
  - Added technical requirements
  - Added future enhancements
  - Preserved all content from both backlogs
  - Organized under workstream structure
- 13:12 - Archived CATALOG_BACKLOG.md after content verification
- 13:13 - Updated documentation to reflect unified backlog:
  - README.md: Added workstream overview
  - PROJECT_PLAN.md: Added project management section
  - Both files now reference unified backlog approach
- 13:19 - Renamed Infrastructure workstream to Program Management:
  - Better reflects its role in standards, processes, and coordination
  - Encompasses documentation, quality, and best practices
  - Provides clearer understanding of workstream's purpose
- 13:24 - Renamed SETUP.md to SETUP_GUIDE.md:
  - Standardizes guide naming convention
  - Simple rename instead of create-and-archive
  - Updated references in README.md and PROJECT_PLAN.md
- 13:27 - Updated references in SETUP_GUIDE.md:
  - Changed `guidelines.md` to `CODE_STANDARDS.md`
  - Verified all content preserved after rename
  - All references now use standardized names
- 13:54 - Decision to move guides to docs folder:
  - Discovered most guides already in /docs
  - Need to:
    1. Move any remaining guides
    2. Update references in README.md and PROJECT_PLAN.md
    3. Ensure consistent naming conventions
    4. Update cross-references
- 13:55 - Updated README.md with correct doc paths
- 13:56 - Updated PROJECT_PLAN.md documentation section
  - Reorganized into clear categories
  - Updated all guide references to /docs
  - Simplified structure description
- 13:57 - Standardized guide naming in /docs:
  - Renamed code_standards.md -> CODE_STANDARDS.md
  - Renamed testing_guide.md -> TESTING_GUIDE.md
  - All guides now use uppercase naming
- 13:59 - Restored detailed content in PROJECT_PLAN.md:
  - Kept new organization structure
  - Added back detailed descriptions for each document
  - Maintained comprehensive documentation overview
  - Preserved important context and guidelines

## Key Decisions
1. Maintain flat documentation structure instead of deep hierarchy
2. Added "Incremental Development" as a core principle
3. Standardized documentation naming and organization
4. Enhanced session management documentation to include start-of-session logging
5. Adopt single-file backlog management to reduce complexity and improve visibility
6. Rename Infrastructure workstream to Program Management for clarity
7. Move guides to docs folder for consistent organization

## Next Steps
1. Continue documentation restructuring:
   - Create documentation index in README.md
   - Standardize naming of existing documentation files
   - Update cross-references between documents

## Questions/Issues Identified
1. Session logging wasn't properly documented as a start-of-session requirement
2. Some documentation organization principles needed clearer documentation
