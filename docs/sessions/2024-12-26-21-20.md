## Backlog Updates
### New Items Added
- Asset Catalog Testing
  - Priority: High
  - Workstream: Asset Management
  - Description: Create comprehensive test suite for asset catalog system

### Items Updated
- Database Test Configuration
  - Previous Status: Issue
  - New Status: Resolved

## Session Summary
This session focused on implementing a new asset catalog system to help organize and track project files, their relationships, and metadata. We created the necessary models, services, and utilities to manage the catalog. We also reviewed and documented the session logging system, creating this session log as part of that process.

The asset catalog implementation includes:
- Models for tracking files, tags, and dependencies
- Service layer for managing assets
- Utility script for automatic catalog population
- Support for metadata extraction and dependency tracking

Next session will focus on testing the implementation and integrating it with existing systems.
