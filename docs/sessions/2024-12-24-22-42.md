## Objectives
- Clean up and consolidate documentation in MARIAN_DESIGN_AND_DECISIONS.md
- Remove duplicate sections while preserving unique information

## Accomplished
- Reviewed and analyzed duplicate sections in MARIAN_DESIGN_AND_DECISIONS.md
- Identified complementary vs truly duplicate information
- Maintained document structure and readability
- Committed changes with descriptive commit message

## Decisions
- Kept both versions of Timestamp Storage as they contained different information:
  - Implementation details in one section
  - Storage considerations in another
- Preserved Testing Strategy sections as they covered different aspects:
  - General principles in one section
  - Specific test coverage in another
- Maintained detailed Duplicate Handling section while removing redundancy

## Follow-up Tasks
- Review the Data Storage and Schema section for potential consolidation
- Consider adding implementation examples for key features
- Review other documentation files for similar duplicate sections
