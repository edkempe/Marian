## Session Summary 2024-12-25 21:16 MST

### Completed Tasks
- Added progress logging to long-running Gmail API integration tests
- Documented test output buffering issue in TROUBLESHOOTING.md
- Verified all tests are passing with real Gmail API integration

### Code Changes
- Modified `tests/test_integration.py`:
  - Added detailed progress logging in `test_email_processing`
  - Added detailed progress logging in `test_email_date_queries`
  - Updated assertions to verify email structure instead of specific content
- Updated `docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md`:
  - Added section about test execution appearing to stall
  - Documented pytest output buffering limitation
  - Added recommendations for handling long-running tests

### Environment Changes
- No new dependencies added
- No configuration changes
- No database migrations

### Issues and Blockers
- Pytest output buffering prevents seeing progress logs during test execution
  - This is a known limitation of pytest
  - Added to troubleshooting guide for future reference
  - Consider investigating pytest plugins that might help with this

### Testing Status
- All tests passing (14 tests, 47.76s execution time)
- No new tests added
- Test modifications focused on logging and structure verification
- Verified real Gmail API integration working correctly

### Technical Decisions
- Decided to verify email structure rather than specific content in tests
  - Rationale: Tests should be resilient to changes in actual email content
  - Alternative considered: Creating test emails with specific content (rejected due to complexity)
- Added progress logging despite buffering issue
  - Rationale: Logs still useful for debugging failures
  - Alternative considered: Custom pytest plugin (rejected as over-engineering)
