# Session Summary: December 23, 2024 12:58 MST

## User Intent
Updating Email Model and Tests - The goal was to align the email model and tests with the new schema changes.

## Key Changes Made
1. **Email Model Updates:**
   - Renamed `sender` field to `from_address`
   - Added new field `to_address`
   - Changed `date` field to `received_date`
   - Renamed `body` field to `content`

2. **Modified Files:**
   - `/Users/eddiekempe/CodeProjects/Marian/app_get_mail.py`:
     - Updated database schema to match new Email model fields
     - Modified email processing logic to use new field names
     - Improved date handling and timezone support
     - Enhanced error handling and logging
     - Simplified label history schema

## Dependencies and APIs
- SQLAlchemy for ORM and database operations
- Gmail API for email fetching
- Timezone handling with pytz

## Design Decisions
- Maintained Email model as the source of truth for database schema
- Used UTC for internal date storage while displaying in Mountain Time
- Improved error handling and logging for better debugging
- Simplified label history tracking

## Environmental Variables
No changes to environmental variables were made during this session.

## Issues and Blockers
1. Tests need to be run to verify the schema changes
2. Need to verify timezone handling across all components
3. Label history schema simplification needs validation

## Next Steps
1. Run comprehensive tests to verify schema changes
2. Validate timezone handling in edge cases
3. Test label history functionality with the simplified schema
4. Review and update any remaining components that might be affected by the schema changes

## Additional Notes
- The changes focused on maintaining data consistency while improving code organization
- Documentation has been updated to reflect the new schema
- Error handling has been enhanced throughout the codebase
