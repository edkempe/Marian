# Session Log: Testing Strategy Implementation
Date: 2024-12-26
Time: 18:01-18:20 MST

## Session Goals
- Document testing strategy
- Implement pure function tests
- Explain rationale for avoiding mocks

## Changes Made

### 1. Documentation
Created [docs/testing.md](../testing.md):
- Documented testing philosophy
- Explained why we avoid mocking the Claude API
- Provided best practices for different test types
- Added instructions for running tests

### 2. Test Implementation
Created [tests/test_pure_functions.py](../../tests/test_pure_functions.py):
- Added tests for JSON extraction utilities
- Implemented EmailAnalysisResponse validation tests
- Added Claude response parsing tests
- All tests are dependency-free

### 3. Git Commits
1. `c6b58f0` - refactor: improve email analysis prompt for more reliable JSON responses
2. `f4f334e` - test: improve API testing configuration and error handling
3. `64de734` - docs: add testing strategy documentation and pure function tests

## Key Decisions
1. Chose to avoid mocking due to:
   - Previous difficulties with mock maintenance
   - Complexity of Claude API behavior
   - Need for reliable test results

2. Implemented hybrid approach:
   - Integration tests for API functionality
   - Pure function tests for utilities
   - Test fixtures for reusability

## Next Steps
1. Review testing documentation
2. Run new pure function tests
3. Add more tests following strategy
4. Consider implementing response caching

## Notes
- Pure function tests run quickly and reliably
- Integration tests provide high confidence
- Documentation serves as guide for future development
