# 8. Secure Token Storage

Date: 2024-12-31

## Status

Backlog

## Context

Currently, we use pickle for storing OAuth2 tokens for Gmail API authentication. This presents several security concerns:
1. Pickle is inherently unsafe as it can execute arbitrary code
2. Tokens are stored unencrypted
3. No key rotation or secure deletion

## Decision

We will continue using pickle-based storage for now, but plan to migrate to a more secure solution in the future. The planned approach includes:

### 1. Token Storage Format
- **Current**: `token.pickle` using pickle serialization (to be maintained)
- **Future**: `token.json` using JSON serialization
- **Rationale**: JSON is secure, human-readable, and recommended by Google

### 2. Future Security Enhancements (Backlog)
1. **Encryption**:
   - Use the `keyring` library for secure credential storage
   - Leverage system keychain when available
   - Fall back to encrypted file storage

2. **Token Management**:
   - Implement token rotation
   - Secure token deletion
   - Token refresh monitoring

3. **Access Control**:
   - File permissions enforcement
   - Separation of token storage from application code
   - Clear error handling for permission issues

## Consequences

### Current (with pickle)
1. Quick implementation and compatibility with existing code
2. Known security risks that need to be managed
3. Technical debt to be addressed

### Future (after migration)
1. Improved security
2. Alignment with Google best practices
3. Better error handling
4. Human-readable token storage
