# 5. Minimal Security Testing Approach for MVP

Date: 2024-12-29

## Status

Accepted

## Context

During MVP development, we need to balance security testing with development speed. We need essential security checks without overburdening the development process while it's a single-developer project.

## Decision

We will use Bandit as our primary security testing tool for the MVP phase, focusing only on high-severity issues. We chose Bandit because:

1. It's lightweight and easy to integrate
2. Covers critical security vulnerabilities:
   - SQL injection
   - Command injection
   - Path traversal
   - Unsafe deserialization
   - Hardcoded secrets
3. Requires minimal configuration
4. Can run as part of our test suite

Other security tools and checks are deliberately deferred:
- Dependency vulnerability scanning (Safety)
- Secret scanning (detect-secrets)
- OWASP dependency checking
- Compliance requirements (GDPR, NIST)

## Consequences

### Positive
- Simple, automated security testing
- Focus on most critical vulnerabilities
- Low maintenance overhead
- Quick feedback cycle

### Negative
- Less comprehensive security coverage
- May need significant security review before production
- Could miss some dependency vulnerabilities
- No automated secret detection

### Future Considerations
Future security enhancements are tracked in the backlog and should be implemented before moving to production.
