# ADR 0000: Foundational Subsystem Architecture - Jexi as a Hub-and-Spoke System

## Status
Proposed

## Context
This is a foundational architectural decision that defines how Jexi and its subsystems interact. All other architectural decisions (ADRs 0001-NNNN) build upon this foundation.

As Jexi grows in capabilities, we need a scalable architecture that allows for specialized subsystems while maintaining a unified user experience. Users should be able to interact with specialized subsystems either directly or through Jexi as a central coordinator.

## Decision
We will implement a hub-and-spoke architecture where:

1. **Jexi (The Hub)**
   - Acts as the primary personal assistant
   - Provides a unified interface to all subsystems
   - Can coordinate between subsystems
   - Maintains context across interactions
   - Offers a "one-stop" experience for users

2. **Specialized Subsystems (The Spokes)**
   - Each has a specific domain of responsibility
   - Can be accessed directly by users
   - Can coordinate through Jexi
   - Maintain their own expertise and data
   - Scale independently

### Initial Subsystems

1. **Marian (The Librarian)**
   - Domain: Knowledge Management
   - Maintains the Catalog system
   - Tracks where information is stored
   - Manages metadata and relationships
   - Provides library services

2. **Sue (Executive Assistant)**
   - Domain: Work Management
   - Handles professional tasks
   - Manages work communications
   - Coordinates meetings and schedules
   - Tracks work projects

3. **Coach**
   - Domain: Personal Development
   - Tracks goals and progress
   - Provides motivation and accountability
   - Suggests improvement strategies
   - Monitors personal metrics

4. **Doctor**
   - Domain: Health Management
   - Tracks health metrics
   - Monitors wellness goals
   - Coordinates with health providers
   - Manages health records

### Access Patterns

1. **Direct Access**
   ```
   User -> Subsystem
   Example: User -> Marian for direct library queries
   ```

2. **Coordinated Access**
   ```
   User -> Jexi -> Subsystem(s)
   Example: User -> Jexi -> Marian + Sue for project research
   ```

3. **Multi-System Coordination**
   ```
   User -> Jexi -> [Subsystem A <-> Subsystem B]
   Example: User -> Jexi -> [Coach <-> Doctor] for health goals
   ```

## Consequences

### Advantages
1. **Scalability**
   - New subsystems can be added independently
   - Each subsystem can scale based on its needs
   - Distributed responsibility and expertise

2. **Flexibility**
   - Users can choose their preferred interaction pattern
   - Direct access for power users
   - Coordinated access for convenience

3. **Specialization**
   - Each subsystem can deeply focus on its domain
   - Specialized features and optimizations
   - Domain-specific expertise

4. **Maintainability**
   - Clear separation of concerns
   - Independent development possible
   - Easier testing and deployment

### Challenges
1. **Consistency**
   - Need to maintain consistent user experience
   - Standardized communication protocols
   - Unified data models where appropriate

2. **Coordination**
   - Complex multi-system interactions
   - State management across systems
   - Transaction handling

3. **Authentication**
   - Single sign-on requirements
   - Permission management
   - Security coordination

## Implementation Guidelines

1. **Communication Protocol**
   - Standardized API format
   - Event-based communication
   - Clear state management
   - Error handling protocols

2. **Data Management**
   - Clear data ownership
   - Consistent metadata format
   - Shared reference system
   - Version control

3. **User Experience**
   - Consistent interface patterns
   - Clear system identification
   - Smooth transitions
   - Context preservation

4. **Security**
   - Unified authentication
   - Role-based access control
   - Audit logging
   - Privacy protection
