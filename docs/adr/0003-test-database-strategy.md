# 3. Test Database Strategy

Date: 2024-12-29

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to decide on a strategy for handling databases in our test environment. The options considered were:

1. Using the production databases with transaction rollbacks
2. Using in-memory SQLite databases for tests
3. Using separate test databases that mirror production setup

Each approach has different implications for test reliability, data safety, and maintenance.

## Decision

We will use separate test databases that mirror the production setup. Specifically:

1. Test databases will:
   - Use SQLite like production
   - Have separate database files in a test-specific directory
   - Be created fresh for each test session
   - Be automatically cleaned up after tests complete

2. Implementation will use:
   - A TestDatabaseFactory to manage database lifecycle
   - SQLAlchemy for database operations
   - pytest fixtures for setup and teardown
   - Transaction-based cleanup between individual tests

## Rationale

We chose separate test databases over alternatives because:

1. **Data Safety**: Eliminates any risk of tests affecting production data
2. **Test Isolation**: Ensures tests run in a clean, controlled environment
3. **Performance**: Avoids impact on production database performance
4. **Consistency**: Tests always run against a known database state
5. **Security**: Prevents exposure of sensitive production data in tests

This follows industry best practices as recommended by major frameworks and testing guides.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Complete isolation from production data
- Tests can't accidentally affect production
- Consistent test environment
- Better test reliability
- Supports parallel test execution
- Easier debugging (can inspect test database state)

### Negative

- Need to maintain separate test database setup
- Slightly slower than in-memory databases
- Need to ensure test database schema stays in sync with production
- Additional disk space for test database files

## Implementation

1. TestDatabaseFactory will:
   - Create test databases in `tests/test_data/`
   - Manage database connections and sessions
   - Handle cleanup automatically

2. Each test will:
   - Get a clean database session
   - Run in its own transaction
   - Have changes rolled back after completion

3. Test setup will:
   - Create fresh test databases for each test session
   - Initialize schema using production models
   - Clean up all test files after completion
