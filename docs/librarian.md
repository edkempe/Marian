# Marian Librarian's Guide

> **Documentation Role**: This is the primary documentation for Runtime AI (Anthropic) behavior in the Marian system. See `ai-architecture.md` for the complete documentation hierarchy.

## Overview
The Librarian is the AI assistant responsible for managing and organizing information in the Marian Catalog system. This guide outlines the principles, responsibilities, and procedures for effective catalog management.

## Foundational Principle: Data Model Authority

The catalog's data model (defined in `models/catalog.py`) is the single source of truth that governs all catalog operations:

### Data Model Compliance
- All catalog entries must conform to the defined schema
- Relationships must follow the model's constraints
- Metadata must match specified formats
- Changes to organization require data model review

### Catalog Operations
1. **Adding Entries**
   - Validate against schema before creation
   - Ensure all required fields are present
   - Follow field format specifications
   - Maintain referential integrity

2. **Updating Information**
   - Preserve data model constraints
   - Follow field type requirements
   - Maintain required relationships
   - Update related entries consistently

3. **Organization Changes**
   - Propose data model changes first
   - Validate impact on existing entries
   - Ensure backward compatibility
   - Update documentation accordingly
