# Development Session Log - 2024-12-26 18:23

## Session Focus
Initial review of project documentation and testing strategy, followed by database schema and code organization improvements.

## Objectives
1. Review and understand project guidelines
2. Review testing strategy and approach
3. Ensure development environment is properly configured
4. Review and improve code organization
5. Centralize hard-coded values into constants
6. Verify database schema alignment with models
7. Document needed database migrations

## Running Log

18:23 - Started session
- Reviewed CHAT_START.md
- Reviewed project GUIDELINES.md
- Reviewed testing.md documentation
- Created session log

## Work Completed

### 1. Constants Centralization
- Added new constant categories in `constants.py`:
  - `COLUMN_SIZES` for database column length limits
  - `DEFAULT_VALUES` for default field values
  - `VALIDATION` for field validation rules
  - `AssetTypes` class for asset type constants
  - `SentimentTypes` class for sentiment values
  - `DATE_PATTERNS` for date format validation

### 2. Model Updates
- Updated models to use centralized constants:
  - `Email` model now uses `COLUMN_SIZES` and `DEFAULT_VALUES`
  - `GmailLabel` model uses `COLUMN_SIZES`
  - `EmailAnalysis` model uses `VALIDATION`, `DEFAULT_VALUES`, `SentimentTypes`, and `DATE_PATTERNS`
  - `AssetCatalogItem` model uses `AssetTypes`

### 3. Database Schema Analysis
Identified misalignments between models and schemas:
1. **Email Database**
   - Migration uses `Integer` for `id` but model uses `Text`
   - Migration has `body` column but model has `content`
   - Migration has `sender` but model has `from_address` and `to_address`
   - Column lengths and constraints don't match

2. **Analysis Database**
   - Migration has `raw_analysis` but model uses `full_api_response`
   - Migration includes `links_found` and `links_display` which were removed
   - Migration has `ref_docs` which isn't in the model

3. **Asset Catalog Database**
   - No migration files exist for the asset catalog tables
   - Currently relies only on SQLAlchemy's `create_all()`

## Known Issues
1. Database schema misalignments need to be fixed with new migrations
2. Need to update the email table schema to match Email model
3. Need to update email analysis table to match EmailAnalysis model
4. Need to create initial migrations for asset catalog tables

## Next Steps
1. Create new database migrations to align schemas with models:
   - Update email table schema
   - Update email analysis table
   - Create initial asset catalog migrations
2. Update `init_db.py`:
   - Use migrations instead of direct `create_all()`
   - Add proper error handling
   - Add version checking

## Key Decisions
- Will follow no-mock testing policy as documented
- Will maintain detailed session logs
- Will ensure all changes are incremental and documented
- Centralize all configuration values in `constants.py`
- Use class-based constants for better type safety
- Plan to use migrations for all schema changes going forward

## Commits Made
1. feat(catalog): implement asset catalog database management
   - Add session management for asset catalog database
   - Update asset catalog service to use new session
   - Add analyze_catalog.py script for asset analysis
   - Update init_db.py to handle catalog tables
   - Update populate_asset_catalog.py with latest schema

2. refactor: centralize hard-coded values in constants
   - Move database column sizes to constants
   - Move default values to constants
   - Move validation rules to constants
   - Create type-safe constant classes
   - Update models to use centralized constants
