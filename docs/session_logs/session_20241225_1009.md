2. 10:10 AM MST
   - Identified documentation consolidation needs:
     - Multiple session file formats in use
     - Database schema documentation needs updating
     - Testing documentation spread across multiple files

3. 10:11 AM MST
   - Created standardized `SESSION_TEMPLATE.md`
   - Updated session README with clear guidelines
   - Aligned current session with new template

4. 10:15 AM MST
   - Created consolidated database schema documentation
   - Added catalog database schema details
   - Updated field constraints and implementation notes
   - Created new `database_schema.md` as single source of truth

5. 10:20 AM MST
   - Created comprehensive testing guide
   - Added catalog testing requirements
   - Documented test implementation standards
   - Created new `testing_guide.md` as reference

6. 10:16 AM MST
   - Consolidated testing documentation:
     - Incorporated semantic testing content from testing.md
     - Moved old testing.md to archive
     - Single source of truth in testing_guide.md

7. 10:19 AM MST
   - Updated documentation to establish data model as single source of truth:
     - Modified database_schema.md to explicitly define its role
     - Added data model validation requirements
     - Updated testing_guide.md with data model test hierarchy
     - Added new test category for data model validation

8. 10:21 AM MST
   - Established data model authority across key documentation:
     - Added to PROJECT_PLAN.md core principles
     - Updated AI_SESSION_GUIDE.md with implementation guidelines
     - Added to LIBRARIAN_GUIDE.md as foundational principle
     - Ensured consistent messaging across documents

9. 10:24 AM MST
   - Identified issue with data model implementation:
     - database_schema.md is redundant documentation
     - Need SQLAlchemy models as true source of truth
     - constants.py already serves as config source of truth
   - Plan to create proper data models:
     1. Create SQLAlchemy models for schema definition
     2. Use constants.py for configuration
     3. Remove redundant documentation

10. 10:28 AM MST
   - Discovered existing SQLAlchemy models are already source of truth:
     - models/email.py for email schema
     - models/catalog.py for catalog schema
     - models/email_analysis.py for analysis schema
   - Models have proper:
     - Type annotations
     - Constraints
     - Relationships
     - Documentation

11. 10:34 AM MST
   - Made key architectural decision on data model implementation:
     - Keep SQLAlchemy models as primary source of truth
     - Use alembic migrations for schema tracking
     - Remove redundant schema documentation
     - Reference models directly in docs
   - Decision based on codebase analysis:
     - Heavy usage of SQLAlchemy features
     - Type safety benefits
     - Relationship management
     - Test infrastructure integration

12. 10:38 AM MST
   - Created comprehensive model usage guide:
     - Overview of model structure
     - Working with models
     - Schema changes
     - Common patterns
     - Troubleshooting
   - Guide covers:
     - Type safety
     - Relationships
     - Best practices
     - Common issues

13. 10:39 AM MST
   - Identified documentation overlap:
     - database_design.md: Schema decisions
     - code_standards.md: Type hints and docs
   - Updated model_guide.md to:
     - Reference existing docs
     - Avoid duplication
     - Focus on practical usage
   - Clarified documentation roles:
     - model_guide.md: How to use models
     - database_design.md: Why decisions made
     - code_standards.md: Project-wide standards

14. 10:40 AM MST
   - Determined model guide is unnecessary:
     - Models are self-documenting
     - Tests show usage patterns
     - SQLAlchemy docs exist
     - Code standards cover style
   - Decision follows "necessary and sufficient":
     - Remove model_guide.md
     - Keep database_design.md for decisions
     - Reference SQLAlchemy docs
     - Use tests as examples

15. 10:41 AM MST
   - Archived redundant documentation:
     - model_guide.md → archive/model_guide_20241225.md
     - database_schema.md → archive/database_schema_20241225.md
   - Documentation now points to:
     - SQLAlchemy models for schema
     - Tests for usage examples
     - SQLAlchemy docs for framework details
     - database_design.md for decisions

16. 11:05 AM MST
   - Implemented clear archive naming convention:
     - Format: `ARCHIVED_YYYYMMDD_HHMM_filename.ext`
     - Both location and name mark as archived
   - Renamed archived files:
     - `model_guide_20241225.md` → `ARCHIVED_20241225_1039_model_guide.md`
     - `database_schema_20241225.md` → `ARCHIVED_20241225_1019_database_schema.md`
     - `testing_20241225.md` → `ARCHIVED_20241224_1457_testing.md`
     - `database_schema_20241223.md` → `ARCHIVED_20241223_1840_database_schema.md`
   - Moved ADR001 to archive:
     - `ADR001_SQLAlchemy_Models_as_Source_of_Truth.md` → `ARCHIVED_20241225_1105_ADR001_SQLAlchemy_Models.md`

17. 11:28 AM MST
   - Implemented backup system documentation:
     - Created BACKUP_GUIDE.md with:
       - 3-2-1 backup strategy
       - Directory structure
       - Retention policies
       - Success criteria
     - Added backup metadata structure:
       - JSON format for tracking
       - File inventory
       - Status tracking
       - Integrity verification

18. 11:34 AM MST
   - Completed documentation reorganization:
     - Updated PROJECT_PLAN.md with new structure
     - Added backup and archive guides to documentation
     - Ensured all documentation points to SQLAlchemy models
     - Cleaned up old files and references
