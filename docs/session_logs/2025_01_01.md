### Summary of Work Done

#### Key Modifications
1. **Completed Mutable Defaults Fix**:
   - Fixed all remaining mutable defaults in constants:
     - `versioning.py`: Updated `SUPPORTED_API_VERSIONS`, `DEPRECATED_API_VERSIONS`, and `VERSION_COMPATIBILITY`
     - `api.py`: Created new `ApiConstants` dataclass with proper immutable collections
     - `file.py`: Created `FileConstants` dataclass with proper immutable paths and collections

2. **Import Structure Improvements**:
   - `__init__.py`: 
     - Replaced wildcard imports with explicit imports
     - Added proper re-exports for backward compatibility
     - Updated `__all__` list to include all exported constants

3. **Enhanced Constants Organization**:
   - `config.py`: Added missing module-specific configurations
     - Added CATALOG, EMAIL, and LOGGING configurations
     - Added DEV_DEPENDENCIES and VALID_SENTIMENTS sets
   - `file.py`: Added new structured constants
     - Added project directory constants (ROOT_DIR, DOCS_DIR, etc.)
     - Added file categories and size categories
     - Converted string paths to `pathlib.Path` objects

#### Design Decisions
1. Used `dataclass(frozen=True)` for all constant classes to ensure immutability
2. Standardized the use of `field(default_factory=...)` for all mutable defaults
3. Organized constants hierarchically within their respective domains
4. Maintained backward compatibility through careful re-exports

#### Current Status
- All identified mutable defaults have been fixed
- Constants are now properly organized and immutable
- Import structure has been cleaned up and standardized
- Some test failures remain due to import changes that need to be addressed

#### Next Steps
1. **Testing**:
   - Fix remaining test failures related to import changes
   - Add tests to verify constant immutability

2. **Documentation**:
   - Update documentation to reflect new constants structure
   - Add docstrings for new constant classes

3. **Code Review**:
   - Review any remaining constants files for similar patterns
   - Ensure all constants follow the new immutable pattern

4. **Validation**:
   - Consider adding runtime validation for constant immutability
   - Add type hints validation

### Modified Files
1. `/shared_lib/constants/versioning.py`
2. `/shared_lib/constants/api.py`
3. `/shared_lib/constants/file.py`
4. `/shared_lib/constants/__init__.py`
5. `/shared_lib/constants/config.py`

### Notes
- Focus was on completing the mutable defaults fix while improving overall organization
- Changes make the codebase more maintainable and less prone to bugs
- Need to address test failures in next session
