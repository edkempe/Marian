# Development Session Log: 2024-12-27

## Session Focus
Updating testing documentation to reflect Jexi project structure and AI component roles

## Work Completed
1. Created new-testing-guide.md as a working copy of testing-guide.md
2. Started incremental updates to reflect Jexi structure
3. Committed initial documentation changes

## Action Items for Next Session
1. Start fresh with updating testing-guide.md to reflect Jexi architecture:
   - Make incremental, well-documented changes
   - Update each section systematically
   - Ensure proper version control

2. Update testing guide sections in this order:
   - Introduction and core principles
   - Test categories for AI components (Jexi, Marian, Cassy)
   - API references and examples
   - Test environment setup

3. Review and update related documentation:
   - Ensure consistency with ai-architecture.md
   - Update references in librarian.md
   - Check other dependent documentation

## Notes
- Need to improve process for incremental documentation updates
- Consider creating a documentation update checklist
- Important to maintain backward compatibility during transition

## Next Steps
1. Update introduction section:
   - Change project scope from Marian to Jexi
   - Add AI component context
   - Reference ai-architecture.md hierarchy

2. Reorganize test categories:
   - Structure around Jexi, Marian, and Cassy components
   - Update test file locations and names
   - Add new AI interaction test patterns

3. Update API references:
   - Replace Claude API references with current AI structure
   - Update example code and test patterns
   - Add new AI integration test examples

4. Review and validate changes:
   - Check all file paths and references
   - Verify test patterns are current
   - Ensure backward compatibility
