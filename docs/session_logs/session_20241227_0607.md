06:23 MST - Version Tracking Added
- Added version tracking to key documents:

  - GUIDELINES.md (v1.0.0): Initial guidelines covering key policies
  - BACKLOG.md (v1.0.0): Initial backlog with workstreams
  - SETUP_GUIDE.md (v1.0.0): Initial setup and configuration guide

06:26 MST - Documentation Reference Updates

  - chat_session_util.py: Updated docstring and function name
  - PROJECT_PLAN.md: Updated documentation section
- All references now point to SESSION_WORKFLOW.md

06:32 MST - Script Organization
- Moved chat_session_util.py from shared_lib to scripts directory
- Renamed to chat_session_manager.py to better reflect its purpose
- Rationale:
  - Not shared across application code
  - Development utility script
  - Similar to other scripts in scripts directory
  - Name better reflects its management role

06:33 MST - Script Location History
- Found previous history of chat session script:
  - Originally was scripts/chat_session_manager.py
  - Moved to shared_lib/chat_session_util.py on Dec 25
  - Now moved back to scripts/chat_session_manager.py
- Current location is more appropriate because:
  - It's a development utility script
  - Not shared across application code
  - Belongs with other scripts
  - Name better reflects its role

06:35 MST - Directory Purpose Clarification
- Updated documentation to clarify shared_lib purpose:
  - Must be referenced by multiple application files
  - Contains utilities, constants, and helpers
  - Not for standalone scripts or development tools
  - Example: database_session_util.py used by apps and services
- Updated in:
  - PROJECT_PLAN.md
  - README.md
- This clarification supports our decision to move chat_session_manager.py to scripts/

06:36 MST - Project Management Checklist
