# Session Summary 2024-12-23 12:04 MST

## Changes Made
1. Documented decision to keep `full_api_response` as TEXT type in database_design.md
   - Added rationale and benefits for debugging and data integrity
   - Updated historical changes section

2. Updated BACKLOG.md
   - Added email retrieval and processing prototype as highest priority task
   - Added specific task for Email model date field change under date standardization
   - Moved Future JSON Type Migration to backlog with low priority
   - Reorganized priorities to focus on working prototype first

3. Reorganized Tasks
   - Prioritized email retrieval prototype as immediate focus
   - Kept Gmail API validation as second high priority
   - Moved optimization tasks to backlog
   - Maintained detailed validation requirements

## Key Decisions
1. Keep `full_api_response` as TEXT type instead of JSON
   - Preserves exact API responses even when malformed
   - Enables better debugging of API issues
   - Allows tracking of non-JSON responses
   - Validation handled in application layer

2. Prioritize working prototype over optimizations
   - Email retrieval and processing is now highest priority
   - Date field optimization moved to low priority
   - JSON type migration moved to backlog
   - Focus on essential functionality first

## Modified Files
- M docs/database_design.md
- M BACKLOG.md
- M NEXT_SESSION.md

## Next Steps
