   - Finally update root README.md
2. Create new README files using template:
   - Core components: models, src, shared_lib
   - Support systems: config, data, services
   - Development tools: scripts, tests, migrations

## Issues and Blockers
- Migration of existing session logs needed
  - Impact: Medium
  - Resolution: Create script to rename and merge session logs by date
  - Backlog Item Created: Yes
- **Test Failures**:
   - Missing dependencies: bs4, networkx, pkg_resources
   - DEFAULT_MODEL import errors in multiple files
   - Test data module structure issues
- **Duplicate Files**:
   - Multiple identical README.md files across directories
   - Duplicate egg-info directories in root and src/
   - Need to update component-specific README files

## Key Findings and Decisions
- Identified opportunity to improve project organization using standard README.md hierarchy
- Current state has some documentation in standalone files that should be README.md files in their respective directories
- Need to review and plan migration of documentation to follow folder-based README.md pattern
- Clarified that all README.md files should be uppercase (GitHub standard)
- Established relationship between ai-guidelines.md (authoritative source for session management) and session_logs/README.md (specific log procedures)
- Simplified versioning approach based on dev-checklist.md format
- Identified need for clear documentation relationships and references

## Design Decisions
1. **README.md Case Convention**
   - All README.md files will use uppercase (README.md)
   - This follows GitHub standards and improves visibility

2. **Documentation Hierarchy**
   - Each directory should have its own README.md explaining its purpose
   - Parent/child relationships should be clearly documented
   - Cross-references between related documentation

3. **Session Management**
   - ai-guidelines.md remains authoritative source for session management
   - session_logs/README.md focuses on specific log procedures and standards
   - Clear cross-references between these documents

4. **Versioning Format**
   - Simple version numbers (e.g., 1.0.0)
   - Status indicators: Active, Draft, or Authoritative
   - No need for complex versioning rules

## Documentation Review Needed
Following directories should be considered for README.md-based documentation:
- `/archive` - Currently documented in archive-guide.md
- `/backup` - Currently documented in backup-guide.md
- `/src` - Need source code organization documentation
- `/tests` - Need testing guidelines
- `/scripts` - Need utility scripts documentation

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Documentation Structure
1. **Root and Primary Directories**
   - [ ] Verify/create essential directories:
     - `/src`
     - `/tests`
     - `/scripts`
     - `/archive`
     - `/backup`
   - [ ] Create README.md in each using new template
   - [ ] Update root README.md with new structure

2. **Initial Content Migration**
   - [ ] Move archiving.md → /archive/README.md
   - [ ] Move backup.md → /backup/README.md
   - [ ] Move testing-guide.md → /tests/README.md
   - [ ] Create /src/README.md from code-standards.md
   - [ ] Create /scripts/README.md

### Phase 2: Documentation Hierarchy
1. **Documentation Organization**
   - [ ] Update docs/README.md as documentation root
   - [ ] Create process/ subdirectory for workflow docs
   - [ ] Create setup/ subdirectory for environment docs
   - [ ] Move relevant files to new locations

2. **Cross-References**
   - [ ] Update all documentation links
   - [ ] Verify parent/child relationships
   - [ ] Add "Related Documentation" sections

### Phase 3: Session Management
1. **Update Core Documents**
   - [ ] Revise ai-guidelines.md session management
   - [ ] Update session_logs/README.md
   - [ ] Ensure clear cross-references

2. **Migration Validation**
   - [ ] Test all documentation links
   - [ ] Verify all README.md files follow template
   - [ ] Check version numbers and statuses

### Suggested Order
1. Start with /archive and /backup as they're self-contained
2. Move to /tests as it affects development workflow
3. Create /src structure for code organization
4. Tackle /docs reorganization last (most complex)

### Success Criteria
- All directories have README.md files
- All documentation follows new template
- Clear hierarchy and relationships
- No broken cross-references
- Consistent versioning and status

## Next Steps
- [ ] Create migration script for existing session logs
  - Backlog Status: Added
  - Workstream: Documentation
  - Priority: Medium
- [ ] Update remaining documentation references
- [ ] Test chat_session_manager.py with new format
- [ ] Review all standalone guide documents and their corresponding directories
- [ ] Plan migration strategy for moving documentation into README.md files
- [ ] Ensure cross-references are maintained during migration
- [ ] Update documentation hierarchy in project-plan.md and ai-architecture.md
- [ ] Create identified templates in `/docs/templates`
- [ ] Update references to use new template locations
- [ ] Implement template standards across project

## Documentation Standards Update

### README.md Template
```markdown
# Component Name

**Version:** 1.0.0
**Status:** [Active|Draft|Authoritative]

> **Documentation Role**: Brief description of this document's purpose and scope.

## Related Documentation

- This document (`./README.md`) - Brief description
- Supporting documents:
  - `./detailed-guide.md` - Additional details
  - `./api-reference.md` - API documentation
```

### Documentation Guidelines
1. **Version Format**:
   - Simple version number (e.g., 1.0.0)
   - Increment when significant changes are made
   - No need for complex versioning rules

2. **Status Options**:
   - Active: Current, maintained documentation
   - Draft: Work in progress
   - Authoritative: Single source of truth for its domain

3. **Documentation Relationships**:
   - List related documents with brief descriptions
   - Clearly identify the current document's role
   - Reference parent and supporting documentation

### Migration Checklist
For each document migration:
1. [ ] Create new directory if needed
2. [ ] Create README.md with simple template
3. [ ] Migrate content from old location
4. [ ] Add version and status
5. [ ] List related documentation
6. [ ] Update cross-references
7. [ ] Review and validate
