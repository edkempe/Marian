## Key Decisions
1. Maintain flat documentation structure instead of deep hierarchy
2. Added "Incremental Development" as a core principle
3. Standardized documentation naming and organization
4. Enhanced session management documentation to include start-of-session logging
5. Adopt single-file backlog management to reduce complexity and improve visibility
6. Rename Infrastructure workstream to Program Management for clarity
7. Move guides to docs folder for consistent organization

## Next Steps
1. Continue documentation restructuring:
   - Create documentation index in README.md
   - Standardize naming of existing documentation files
   - Update cross-references between documents

## Questions/Issues Identified
1. Session logging wasn't properly documented as a start-of-session requirement
2. Some documentation organization principles needed clearer documentation
