# Development Session Log - December 31, 2024

## Session Focus
Improving test suite performance and reliability by leveraging external tools.

## Key Changes

### Test Suite Improvements
1. **Duplicate File Detection**:
   - Replaced custom implementation with `rmlint` for significant performance gains
   - Test execution time reduced from 41 minutes to 1 second
   - Added proper handling of edge cases (hardlinks, symlinks)

### Dependencies Added
- **rmlint**: Fast duplicate file finder
  - Installation: `brew install rmlint`
  - Purpose: Efficient duplicate file detection in test suite
  - Benefits: 
    - Progressive hashing for speed
    - Handles edge cases
    - Well-maintained and battle-tested
    - Built-in caching and optimization

### Design Decisions
- **External Tool Integration**:
  - Chose to use system-level tools where they provide significant advantages
  - Created ADR to document external tool usage policy
  - Added proper error handling and skip conditions when tools aren't available

### Code Organization
- Updated test suite to focus on business logic rather than implementation details
- Improved error messages and progress reporting
- Added proper documentation for external tool dependencies

## Next Steps
1. Review and potentially apply similar optimizations to other tests
2. Consider other areas where external tools could provide benefits
3. Update CI/CD to ensure external tools are available

## Notes
- All tests passing after changes
- Significant improvement in test suite performance
- Better maintainability with reduced custom code
