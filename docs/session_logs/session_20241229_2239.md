## Overview
Implemented configuration-based schema management system to improve maintainability and align with Infrastructure as Code principles.

## Changes Made

### Documentation
1. Created ADR for configuration-based schema management
2. Added configuration truth hierarchy documentation
3. Updated schema documentation with examples

### Configuration System
1. Created `config/schema.yaml` with complete model definitions
2. Implemented configuration loader with Pydantic models
3. Added support for environment-specific configurations

### Model Updates
1. Updated `Email` model to use configuration-based schema
2. Updated `EmailAnalysis` model to use configuration-based schema
3. Updated `GmailLabel` model to use configuration-based schema
4. Added validation rules and default values

### Archiving
1. Archived deprecated schema constant files:
   - `models/schema_constants.py` → `models/archive/ARCHIVED_20241229_2249_schema_constants.py`
   - `shared_lib/schema_constants.py` → `shared_lib/archive/ARCHIVED_20241229_2249_schema_constants.py`
   - `models/email/constants.py` → `models/archive/ARCHIVED_20241229_2249_email_constants.py`
   - `models/email_analysis/constants.py` → `models/archive/ARCHIVED_20241229_2249_email_analysis_constants.py`

### Tests
1. Added tests for configuration loading and validation
2. Added tests for model creation and relationships
3. Added tests for API response handling

## Commits
1. docs: add configuration truth hierarchy to ADR
2. config: update schema.yaml with complete model definitions
3. feat: add configuration loader with Pydantic models
4. refactor: update models to use configuration-based schema
5. test: add tests for configuration-based models
6. docs: add session log for configuration system implementation
7. chore: archive deprecated schema constant files
8. feat: add database initialization utility and archive model-specific constants

## Next Steps
1. Implement migration system for schema changes
2. Add edge case testing and error handling
3. Add developer documentation for schema changes
4. Create environment setup guide

## Notes
- All tests are passing
- Configuration system supports environment-specific overrides
- Models now use type-safe configuration with validation
- Schema changes are now version-controlled
- Deprecated files have been properly archived following project conventions
- All changes have been pushed to the remote repository
