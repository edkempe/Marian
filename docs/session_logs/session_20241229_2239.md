## Changes Made

### Documentation
1. Created ADR for configuration-based schema management
2. Added configuration truth hierarchy documentation
3. Updated schema documentation with examples

### Configuration System
1. Created `config/schema.yaml` with complete model definitions
2. Implemented configuration loader with Pydantic models
3. Added support for environment-specific configurations

### Model Updates
1. Updated `Email` model to use configuration-based schema
2. Updated `EmailAnalysis` model to use configuration-based schema
3. Updated `GmailLabel` model to use configuration-based schema
4. Added validation rules and default values

## Commits
1. docs: add configuration truth hierarchy to ADR
2. config: update schema.yaml with complete model definitions
3. feat: add configuration loader with Pydantic models
4. refactor: update models to use configuration-based schema
5. test: add tests for configuration-based models

## Next Steps

4. Create environment setup guide

## Notes
- All tests are passing
- Configuration system supports environment-specific overrides
- Models now use type-safe configuration with validation
- Schema changes are now version-controlled
