# Development Session Log - January 1, 2025

## Session Focus
Continuing test environment setup and validation after the migration to Poetry and pyenv.

## Key Changes

### Test Environment Setup
1. **Test Settings Configuration**:
   - Implementing comprehensive test settings
   - Setting up test-specific environment variables
   - Configuring test database and storage paths

2. **Test Infrastructure**:
   - Setting up test fixtures and utilities
   - Implementing mock services for external dependencies
   - Adding test data generators

### Database Testing Strategy Updates (07:35 MST)
1. **Removed In-Memory Databases**:
   - Aligned with ADR-0003 by removing all in-memory database usage
   - Switched to file-based SQLite databases for all test databases
   - Created separate test database files for email, analysis, and catalog subsystems

2. **Enhanced Test Database Lifecycle**:
   - Added proper test database initialization and cleanup
   - Implemented transaction rollback after each test
   - Added automatic database file cleanup between test sessions

3. **Test Isolation Improvements**:
   - Each test now gets a fresh database session
   - Added proper connection disposal
   - Implemented clean state management between tests

## Next Steps
1. Complete test environment validation
2. Add more test coverage for utilities
3. Set up integration test infrastructure
4. Run and validate test suite with new database configuration

## Notes
- Session started at 2025-01-01 06:38:07 MST
- Continuing from previous session's settings refactoring
- Resolved test database configuration issues by following ADR-0003 guidelines

## Session Log - 2025-01-01

## Session Overview
- **Date**: 2025-01-01
- **Focus**: Project Organization and Development Tools
- **Status**: Completed

## Key Activities

### 1. ADR Updates
- Updated ADR-0017 (Utils and Tools Organization)
  - Added specific tooling decisions
  - Clarified development dependencies
  - Added tool organization by purpose
  - Updated status to "Accepted"
  - Added dependency management guidelines

### 2. Development Tools Organization
- Reorganized development tools into categories:
  - Code Quality: black, pylint, mypy, bandit
  - Testing: pytest and related packages
  - Development Workflow: pre-commit

### 3. Package Structure Updates
- Removed unnecessary packages from pyproject.toml
- Added proper package organization
- Fixed issue with reports directory (removed from packages)
- Added proper sdist format for development tools

### 4. Configuration Updates
- Updated pyproject.toml with organized sections
- Added comprehensive tool configurations
- Improved script commands for development tasks
- Added proper coverage configuration

## Technical Details

### Tool Configuration Changes
1. **Code Quality Tools**
   - black: Code formatting
   - pylint: Comprehensive linting
   - mypy: Static type checking
   - bandit: Security checks

2. **Testing Tools**
   - pytest: Test framework
   - pytest-cov: Coverage reporting
   - pytest-mock: Mocking support
   - pytest-asyncio: Async test support
   - pytest-faker: Test data generation

3. **Development Workflow**
   - pre-commit: Git hooks management

### Package Organization
```toml
packages = [
    {include = "src", from = "."},
    {include = "models", from = "."},
    {include = "shared_lib", from = "."},
    {include = "config", from = "."},
    {include = "services", from = "."},
    {include = "utils", from = "."},
    {include = "tools", from = ".", format = "sdist"},
    {include = "scripts", from = "."},
    {include = "alembic", from = "."},
    {include = "migrations", from = "."}
]
```

## Next Steps
1. Run full test suite with new configuration
2. Update documentation to reflect new tool organization
3. Review and update any remaining tool configurations
4. Consider adding tool-specific documentation

## Notes
- Removed unused tools (flake8, isort, sphinx) to maintain minimal toolset
- Improved organization aligns with ADR principles
- All changes maintain backward compatibility
