# Development Session Log - January 1, 2025

## Session Focus
Continuing test environment setup and validation after the migration to Poetry and pyenv.

## Key Changes

### Test Environment Setup
1. **Test Settings Configuration**:
   - Implementing comprehensive test settings
   - Setting up test-specific environment variables
   - Configuring test database and storage paths

2. **Test Infrastructure**:
   - Setting up test fixtures and utilities
   - Implementing mock services for external dependencies
   - Adding test data generators

### Database Testing Strategy Updates (07:35 MST)
1. **Removed In-Memory Databases**:
   - Aligned with ADR-0003 by removing all in-memory database usage
   - Switched to file-based SQLite databases for all test databases
   - Created separate test database files for email, analysis, and catalog subsystems

2. **Enhanced Test Database Lifecycle**:
   - Added proper test database initialization and cleanup
   - Implemented transaction rollback after each test
   - Added automatic database file cleanup between test sessions

3. **Test Isolation Improvements**:
   - Each test now gets a fresh database session
   - Added proper connection disposal
   - Implemented clean state management between tests

### Code Quality and Tool Integration (09:27 MST)
1. **Tool Usage Documentation**:
   - Updated ADR-0017 with detailed sections on Pylint and Marshmallow usage
   - Added tool selection criteria and best practices
   - Documented current tool configuration and potential improvements

2. **Code Quality Fixes**:
   - Fixed missing imports across test files:
     - Added subprocess and ast to test_process_quality.py
     - Added MagicMock, Email, and test constants to test_get_mail.py
     - Added datetime and timezone to test_models.py
     - Added ValidationError from marshmallow to test_database_utils.py
   - Resolved undefined variable issues in test files
   - Enhanced Pylint integration in test suite

3. **Documentation Updates**:
   - Added new backlog task for ADR indexing and hierarchy
   - Added task to review and optimize development tool usage
   - Enhanced documentation around tool usage and configuration

### Code Organization and Quality Improvements
### Gmail API Code Reorganization
- Consolidated Gmail API functionality:
  - Moved database utility functions (get_oldest_email_date, get_newest_email_date, count_emails) from gmail_utils.py to GmailAPI class
  - Renamed gmail_utils.py to gmail_test_utils.py and kept only test-specific functions
  - Updated imports across test files to reflect new organization
  - Improved error handling in list_labels function

### Linting and Code Quality
- Standardized on pylint as the primary linter:
  - Removed ruff configuration and dependencies from pyproject.toml
  - Updated CI/CD configuration in ADR-0013 to use pylint exclusively
  - Removed unused linting configuration from alembic.ini
  - Fixed decorator usage in GmailAPI class (changed @monitor to @track_api_call)

### Test Suite Organization
- Improved test utilities:
  - Consolidated test helper functions in gmail_test_utils.py
  - Updated test imports to use new module structure
  - Ensured consistent error handling across test utilities

### Known Issues
- Need to verify all tests pass after Gmail API code reorganization
- May need to update additional test files to use new module structure

### Next Steps
1. Run and fix any remaining test failures
2. Review other utilities for potential consolidation
3. Consider adding more comprehensive error handling in GmailAPI class
4. Update documentation to reflect new code organization

### Known Issues
- Marshmallow usage could be expanded for better schema validation
- Some Pylint warnings still need addressing
- Need comprehensive ADR index and hierarchy

### Next Steps
1. Create ADR index with proper categorization
2. Review and optimize development tool usage
3. Address remaining Pylint warnings
4. Consider expanding Marshmallow schema implementation

## Next Steps
1. Complete test environment validation
2. Add more test coverage for utilities
3. Set up integration test infrastructure
4. Run and validate test suite with new database configuration

## Notes
- Session started at 2025-01-01 06:38:07 MST
- Continuing from previous session's settings refactoring
- Resolved test database configuration issues by following ADR-0003 guidelines

## Session Log - 2025-01-01

## Session Overview
- **Date**: 2025-01-01
- **Focus**: Project Organization and Development Tools
- **Status**: Completed

## Key Activities

### 1. ADR Updates
- Updated ADR-0017 (Utils and Tools Organization)
  - Added specific tooling decisions
  - Clarified development dependencies
  - Added tool organization by purpose
  - Updated status to "Accepted"
  - Added dependency management guidelines

### 2. Development Tools Organization
- Reorganized development tools into categories:
  - Code Quality: black, pylint, mypy, bandit
  - Testing: pytest and related packages
  - Development Workflow: pre-commit

### 3. Package Structure Updates
- Removed unnecessary packages from pyproject.toml
- Added proper package organization
- Fixed issue with reports directory (removed from packages)
- Added proper sdist format for development tools

### 4. Configuration Updates
- Updated pyproject.toml with organized sections
- Added comprehensive tool configurations
- Improved script commands for development tasks
- Added proper coverage configuration

## Technical Details

### Tool Configuration Changes
1. **Code Quality Tools**
   - black: Code formatting
   - pylint: Comprehensive linting
   - mypy: Static type checking
   - bandit: Security checks

2. **Testing Tools**
   - pytest: Test framework
   - pytest-cov: Coverage reporting
   - pytest-mock: Mocking support
   - pytest-asyncio: Async test support
   - pytest-faker: Test data generation

3. **Development Workflow**
   - pre-commit: Git hooks management

### Package Organization
```toml
packages = [
    {include = "src", from = "."},
    {include = "models", from = "."},
    {include = "shared_lib", from = "."},
    {include = "config", from = "."},
    {include = "services", from = "."},
    {include = "utils", from = "."},
    {include = "tools", from = ".", format = "sdist"},
    {include = "scripts", from = "."},
    {include = "alembic", from = "."},
    {include = "migrations", from = "."}
]
```

## Next Steps
1. Run full test suite with new configuration
2. Update documentation to reflect new tool organization
3. Review and update any remaining tool configurations
4. Consider adding tool-specific documentation

## Notes
- Removed unused tools (flake8, isort, sphinx) to maintain minimal toolset
- Improved organization aligns with ADR principles
- All changes maintain backward compatibility
