# Session Log: 2024-12-30 - Mocking Policy Review

## Objectives
1. Review and establish mocking policy (ADR-0006)
2. Analyze test dependencies on mocking
3. Evaluate alternatives to mocking for key components

## Current Focus: Gmail API Testing

### Current Implementation
Let's examine the Gmail API testing in test_get_mail.py:

1. What we currently mock:
   - Gmail service object
   - API responses
   - Label operations
   - Message operations

### Analysis: Cost of Removing Mocks

#### Technical Challenges
1. **API Rate Limits**
   - Gmail API has quotas:
     - 1 billion quota units per day
     - 250 quota units per user per second
   - Each operation has different costs:
     - Read message: 5 units
     - List messages: 5 units
     - Modify labels: 5 units

2. **Test Data Management**
   - Need real Gmail accounts for testing
   - Need to maintain consistent test data
   - Need to handle concurrent test runs
   - Need to clean up after tests

3. **Authentication**
   - Need to manage OAuth tokens
   - Need to handle token expiration
   - Need to secure test credentials

4. **Network Dependencies**
   - Tests become dependent on network availability
   - Tests become dependent on Gmail service availability
   - Increased test run time
   - Non-deterministic test behavior

5. **Error Condition Testing**
   - Harder to test error scenarios
   - Can't easily simulate API failures
   - Can't test rate limiting handling
   - Can't test network timeout scenarios

#### Business Impact
1. **Development Velocity**
   - Slower test runs
   - More complex test setup
   - More maintenance overhead

2. **Cost**
   - Need test Gmail accounts
   - API usage costs
   - Additional infrastructure for test data management

3. **Reliability**
   - Tests may fail due to external factors
   - Less predictable CI/CD pipeline
   - Harder to debug test failures

### Potential Alternatives to Mocking

1. **Test Gmail Account**
   - Dedicated test account with controlled data
   - Pros:
     - Real API behavior
     - Real data structures
   - Cons:
     - Cost
     - Maintenance
     - Rate limits
     - Network dependency

2. **Local IMAP Server**
   - Run local mail server for testing
   - Pros:
     - No external dependencies
     - Full control over behavior
     - No rate limits
   - Cons:
     - Different from Gmail API
     - Additional infrastructure
     - Not all Gmail features available

3. **Record/Replay Pattern**
   - Record real API interactions
   - Replay for tests
   - Pros:
     - Real API responses
     - Fast tests
     - No external dependencies
   - Cons:
     - Need to maintain recordings
     - Can become outdated
     - Limited to recorded scenarios

## Initial Recommendation

Based on the analysis, Gmail API mocking appears to be a justified exception to our no-mocking policy because:

1. **External Service**: Gmail is an external service outside our control
2. **Cost Impact**: Real API calls would incur unnecessary costs
3. **Test Reliability**: External dependencies would make tests less reliable
4. **Coverage**: Mocking allows testing error scenarios effectively

### Proposed Guidelines for Gmail Mocking

1. Mock only the API boundary
2. Use real request/response structures
3. Validate mock behavior against real API regularly
4. Document all mock behaviors
5. Keep mock implementation up to date with API changes

## Recent Progress (08:32)

### 07:30 MST - API Testing Strategy
- Reviewed current API testing approach
- Identified areas for improvement in version management
- Started updating ADR-0006 with mocking policy

### 07:45 MST - API Version Management
- Created config/api_versions.json
- Added version tracking for Gmail and Anthropic APIs
- Moved version utilities to shared_lib

### 07:55 MST - Test Environment Investigation
- Discovered Gmail API test capabilities:
  - API Explorer for interactive testing
  - OAuth Playground for auth testing
  - Test transaction support
- Added test endpoints to configuration

### 08:07 MST - Documentation Standards
- Created doc-standards.md with:
  - 500-line limit for new docs
  - Quick reference requirement
  - Clear hierarchy
  - Process guidelines

### 08:13 MST - Documentation Enforcement
- Created shared_lib/doc_standards.py for constants
- Implemented tools/doc_validator.py with:
  - Lenient mode for pre-commit
  - Strict mode for CI
  - Gradual adoption strategy
- Updated pre-commit config for doc validation

### 08:18 MST - Library Reorganization
- Moved shared libraries to correct location:
  - `tests/utils/api_test_utils.py` → `shared_lib/api_utils.py`
  - `tests/utils/gmail_test_utils.py` → `shared_lib/gmail_utils.py`
- Updated imports in `test_get_mail.py`
- Fixed security issues:
  - Added timeout to API requests
  - Added PYTHONPATH setup

### 08:28 MST - Code Organization
- Split changes into logical commits:
  1. Documentation standards and validation
  2. API version tracking
  3. Library reorganization
  4. Migration updates
- Added setup.sh for PYTHONPATH configuration
- Fixed pre-commit hook issues

### 08:29 MST - Gmail Test Transactions
- Added `TestTransaction` class for managing test data lifecycle:
  - Creates test labels and messages
  - Executes test
  - Cleans up test data
- Added `gmail_test_context` for easy test setup:
  ```python
  with gmail_test_context(['INBOX']) as ctx:
      msg_id = ctx.create_message(subject='Test')
      # Run tests...
  # Test data is automatically cleaned up
  ```
- Added utilities for creating test labels and messages

### 08:32 MST - API Monitoring and Tests
- Added `APIMonitor` for tracking metrics:
  - Rate limit tracking
  - Response time monitoring
  - Error tracking
  - Quota management
- Added decorators for API call tracking
- Updated Gmail client with monitoring
- Added integration tests using test context:
  ```python
  with gmail_test_context(['INBOX']) as ctx:
      msg_id = ctx.create_message(subject='Test')
      result = api.process_message(msg_id)
  ```

## Next Steps
1. Add monitoring dashboard
2. Add more integration tests
3. Update remaining API clients with monitoring

## Backlog Items
1. Historical Log Consolidation: Convert session-based logs (pre-2024) to daily format.
   Archive originals. Preserve all content and timestamps.

2. Monitoring Integration: Add system health monitoring for API metrics (health, compatibility, changes, timing, errors).
   Integrate with existing monitoring infrastructure for alerts and dashboards.

## Questions/Blockers
1. How to effectively use Gmail API test environment?
2. Best approach for test transactions?
3. Impact of library moves on existing tests?
