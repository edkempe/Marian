- Identified documentation issues to address

12:37 - Documentation cleanup

- Created new `testing-guide.md` combining both files
- Verified all content was preserved
- Added missing sections and examples
- Improved organization and readability

12:49 - Documentation cleanup
- Archived old testing files with timestamp prefix:
  - `testing.md` -> `ARCHIVED_20241227_1249_testing.md`
  - `testing_guide.md` -> `ARCHIVED_20241227_1249_testing_guide.md`
- Committed changes with descriptive message

12:55 - Documentation reference updates
- Updated `testing-guide.md` to reference `models/` directory as source of truth
- Updated `librarian.md` to reference `models/` directory as source of truth
- Removed references to deprecated `database_schema.md`

## Current Status
1. [x] Removed duplicate code standards file (`code_standards.md`)
2. [x] Updated `docs/README.md` with consistent naming
3. [x] Reviewed temporary documentation file
4. [x] Consolidated testing documentation into `testing-guide.md`
5. [x] Updated references to data models

## Next Steps
1. [ ] Handle temporary rename plan file
2. [ ] Consider standardizing session log naming
3. [ ] Update remaining old document references in project-plan.md
