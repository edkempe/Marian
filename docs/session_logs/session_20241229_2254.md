## Overview
Implemented a comprehensive migration management system to handle database schema changes in a safe and maintainable way.

## Changes Made

### Migration System
1. Created `shared_lib/migration_utils.py` with utilities for:
   - Generating migrations
   - Applying migrations
   - Validating schema changes
   - Managing migration history

2. Created `scripts/manage_migrations.py` CLI tool with commands:
   - `generate`: Create new migrations
   - `apply`: Apply pending migrations
   - `validate`: Validate schema changes
   - `history`: Show migration history
   - `pending`: Show pending migrations

### Testing
1. Added comprehensive test suite in `tests/test_migrations.py`:
   - Unit tests for migration utilities
   - Unit tests for CLI commands
   - Integration tests for complete workflow
   - Mock tests for database operations

### Example Migration
1. Created example migration for user preferences table:
   - Table schema with proper constraints
   - Index for efficient queries
   - Upgrade and downgrade paths

### CI/CD Pipeline
1. Added GitHub Actions workflow for migrations:
   - Automatic validation on PR
   - Migration checks in CI
   - Automatic migration on main branch
   - Environment-specific configuration

2. Added CI scripts:
   - Migration validation script
   - Safe migration application
   - Error handling and reporting

### Documentation
1. Created comprehensive migration guide with:
   - Quick start guide
   - Migration workflow
   - Configuration integration
   - Best practices
   - Troubleshooting guide

### Database Seeding
1. Created database seeding system in `shared_lib/database_seeder.py`:
   - Support for both fake and predefined data
   - Comprehensive seeding utilities
   - Environment-specific seeding
   - Cleanup functionality

2. Added example seed data in `config/seeds/example.yaml`:
   - Sample emails with realistic content
   - Sample email analyses
   - Sample Gmail labels

3. Created seeding CLI tool in `scripts/seed_database.py`:
   - Commands for individual tables
   - Command for seeding all data
   - Support for custom seed files
   - Cleanup command

### Rollback Support
1. Enhanced migration utilities with rollback features:
   - Roll back N steps
   - Roll back to specific revision
   - Detailed revision history
   - Safe rollback procedures

2. Updated CLI tool with rollback commands:
   - `rollback --steps N`: Roll back N migrations
   - `rollback --revision REV`: Roll back to specific revision
   - Enhanced history command with detailed view

### Example Migrations
1. Added user preferences migration:
   - Basic user preferences table
   - Support for key-value preferences
   - Proper indexing and constraints

2. Added user settings migration:
   - Comprehensive user settings table
   - Default values for settings
   - Theme, language, and timezone support
   - Notification preferences

## Key Features
1. Integration with configuration-based schema
2. Schema validation before migration generation
3. Support for multiple databases
4. Migration conflict resolution
5. Comprehensive CLI interface
6. Automated CI/CD pipeline
7. Test coverage for migration system
