## Overview
Implemented a comprehensive migration management system to handle database schema changes in a safe and maintainable way.

## Changes Made

### Migration System
1. Created `shared_lib/migration_utils.py` with utilities for:
   - Generating migrations
   - Applying migrations
   - Validating schema changes
   - Managing migration history

2. Created `scripts/manage_migrations.py` CLI tool with commands:
   - `generate`: Create new migrations
   - `apply`: Apply pending migrations
   - `validate`: Validate schema changes
   - `history`: Show migration history
   - `pending`: Show pending migrations

### Testing
1. Added comprehensive test suite in `tests/test_migrations.py`:
   - Unit tests for migration utilities
   - Unit tests for CLI commands
   - Integration tests for complete workflow
   - Mock tests for database operations

### Example Migration
1. Created example migration for user preferences table:
   - Table schema with proper constraints
   - Index for efficient queries
   - Upgrade and downgrade paths

### CI/CD Pipeline
1. Added GitHub Actions workflow for migrations:
   - Automatic validation on PR
   - Migration checks in CI
   - Automatic migration on main branch
   - Environment-specific configuration

2. Added CI scripts:
   - Migration validation script
   - Safe migration application
   - Error handling and reporting

### Documentation
1. Created comprehensive migration guide with:
   - Quick start guide
   - Migration workflow
   - Configuration integration
   - Best practices
   - Troubleshooting guide

## Key Features
1. Integration with configuration-based schema
2. Schema validation before migration generation
3. Support for multiple databases
4. Migration conflict resolution
5. Comprehensive CLI interface
6. Automated CI/CD pipeline
7. Test coverage for migration system

## Commits
1. feat: add migration management system

   - Add CLI tool
   - Add migration guide
2. feat: complete migration system implementation
   - Add comprehensive test suite
   - Add example migration

   - Add migration validation

## Next Steps
1. Add more example migrations
2. Add database seeding support
3. Add rollback procedures
4. Add monitoring and alerting
5. Add migration dry-run mode

## Notes
- Migration system integrates with existing configuration-based schema

- Documentation covers common use cases and troubleshooting
- System supports both auto-generated and empty migrations
- CI/CD pipeline ensures safe migration deployment
- Test suite provides confidence in migration system
