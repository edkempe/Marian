# Session Log: Database Schema Consolidation
Date: 2025-01-02

## Overview
Today's session focused on consolidating the database schema into a single database while maintaining the existing structure and configurations. The main goal was to simplify the database architecture by moving from multiple databases (email, analysis, catalog) to a single unified database.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Settings (`config/settings/database.py`)
- Simplified database settings to use a single database configuration
- Removed individual database URLs (EMAIL_DB_URL, ANALYSIS_DB_URL, etc.)
- Set up single DATABASE_URL pointing to `data/jexi.db`
- Updated configuration to use JEXI_ environment prefix

### 2. Database Session Utility (`shared_lib/database_session_util.py`)
- Simplified session management to use a single database engine
- Removed specialized session classes (EmailSession, AnalysisSession, CatalogSession)
- Streamlined session factory and context manager
- Updated to use database_settings.DATABASE_URL

### 3. Schema Verification (`scripts/verify_database_schema.py`)
- Updated expected table definitions to match schema.yaml
- Added comprehensive schema verification
- Improved error reporting and validation
- Updated to use database_settings for configuration

### 4. Database Initialization (`scripts/rebuild_db.py`)
- Updated to initialize single database structure
- Simplified test database initialization
- Removed multiple database configurations
- Added proper directory creation

## Source of Truth Hierarchy
```
config/schema.yaml (ROOT SOURCE)
           ↓
┌──────────┴───────────┐
│                      │
schema_constants.py    models/*.py
     ↓                      ↓
database_settings.py    registry.py
           ↓                ↓
database_session_util.py   env.py
           ↓                ↓
    jexi.db (Database)  migrations/
```

## Generation Process
1. Generate schema constants from schema.yaml
2. Generate models, registry, and migration environment
3. Initialize database with new structure
4. Verify database schema

## Verification
- Successfully generated all schema constants
- Generated all models from schema.yaml
- Created single database with correct table structure
- Verified table schemas match expectations

## Next Steps
1. Test database interactions with sample data
2. Update any remaining code that might reference multiple databases
3. Consider adding database migration scripts for production deployment
4. Add comprehensive database backup strategy

## Technical Details
### Database Tables
The following tables were created in the unified database:
- email_messages
- email_analysis
- gmail_labels
- catalog_items
- tags
- item_relationships

Each table maintains its original schema while being consolidated into a single database file.
