# Testing Reports Directory

**Version:** 1.0.0
**Status:** Authoritative

This directory contains automatically generated test reports that provide insights into code quality, documentation standards, and test coverage. These reports are generated by test suites and are not version controlled.

## Report Types

1. **Documentation Quality Reports**
   - `doc_versioning.md`: Status of documentation versioning across the codebase
   - Generated by: `tests/test_doc_quality.py`
   - Purpose: Track which documents have proper version headers and status

2. **Schema Validation Reports**
   - `schema_validation.md`: Database schema validation results
   - Generated by: `tests/test_schema.py`
   - Purpose: Verify model definitions match migrations

3. **Process Quality Reports**
   - `process_quality.md`: Code quality metrics and standards
   - Generated by: `tests/test_process_quality.py`
   - Purpose: Track code quality metrics and standards compliance

4. **Import Analysis Reports**
   - `import_analysis.md`: Analysis of Python imports
   - Generated by: `tests/test_imports.py`
   - Purpose: Identify unused imports, style issues, and circular dependencies
   - Issues are reported as warnings to avoid blocking tests

## Usage

1. **Generating Reports**
   ```bash
   # Generate all test reports
   python -m pytest tests/test_*.py

   # Generate specific report
   python -m pytest tests/test_doc_quality.py
   ```

2. **Reading Reports**
   - Reports are in Markdown format
   - Each report includes:
     - Generation timestamp
     - Test suite version
     - Summary statistics
     - Detailed findings

3. **Report Lifecycle**
   - Reports are regenerated with each test run
   - Old reports are overwritten
   - Reports should not be committed to version control
