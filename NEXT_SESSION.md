## Next Steps
1. **Fix Test Failures**

   - Need to verify schema migration and test database setup
   - Check if test data needs to be updated for new field
   - Update test database setup to match new schema
   - Fix column name mismatches in tests
   - Update mock data to match new schema
   - Update API response mocks

2. **Review Other Changes**

     - app_email_analyzer.py
     - app_email_reports.py
     - migrations/versions/initial_schema.py
     - models/email.py
     - tests/test_email_reports.py
     - tests/test_main.py

3. **Model Improvements (from Backlog)**
   - Fix ID type mismatch (Integer vs String)
   - Improve type safety and documentation
   - Standardize date handling
   - Move to model-first schema approach

## Email Analysis Improvements

### Suggested Next Steps
1. Add database queries to review processed email analyses and their extracted URLs
2. Consider implementing URL validation to ensure extracted URLs are valid
3. Add tests for the new URL extraction functionality
4. Consider adding URL categorization (e.g., social media, documentation, etc.)
5. Add metrics tracking for URL extraction success/failure rates
