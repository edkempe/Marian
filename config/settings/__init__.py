"""Settings package for runtime configuration.

This package provides a centralized location for all runtime configuration using
Pydantic models. Each module defines settings that can be modified through
environment variables.

Usage:
    from config.settings import (
        api_settings,
        db_settings,
        email_settings,
        logging_settings,
        security_settings,
    )
